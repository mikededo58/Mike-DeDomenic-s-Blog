# Mike-DeDomenic-s-Blog

A personal blog I am making

# Description

This blog was made for me to store personal entries. The goal was to have one page for me to submit the entries and a following page to store and display them. All the entries are stored in local storage as an array and pulled onto the second screen as you hit submit. I learned a lot about creating objects and arrays in js as well as how to leverage JSON with local storage to retrieve them. The page also has a light and dark mode for easier viewing depending on the time of the day
